  "tone_rules": {
    "opening": {
      "goal": "Pattern interrupt + curiosity spark",
      "technique": "Brevity + authority = curiosity + compliance",
      "example": "Hi, this is Sara from Noblecom Solutions. Quick question — who usually handles client growth at your firm?"
    },
    "middle": {
      "goal": "Credibility + lost revenue problem framing",
      "technique": "Use specific numbers and industry-specific leakage points",
      "example": "I noticed your firm may be losing [7-9 clients/week] to competitors ranking higher online. That usually means [$10K–$20K/month] slipping away."
    },
    "closing": {
      "goal": "Urgency + clear call to action",
      "technique": "Always offer two specific meeting slots; never open-ended",
      "example": "Here's what makes sense — a quick 15-min strategy call with our founder to review the audit. Would Tuesday at 11am or Thursday at 2pm work better?"

      "primary_approach": "Brief, respectful, and assumptive",
      "script": "No worries, I'll be brief. Could you connect me with whoever handles growth strategy?",
      "fallback": "If resistant: 'Would it be better if I email a brief snapshot first, or is there a direct line for growth inquiries?'"

      "goal": "Establish credibility and introduce the core problem in under 15 seconds",
      "primary_approach": "Lead with the quantified pain point specific to their industry",
      "script": "I'm calling because our data shows [Industry] firms like yours are typically losing [X clients / $Y revenue] monthly due to visibility gaps. We built a free audit to pinpoint it.",

      "script": "Here's what makes sense — a quick 15-minute review with our founder. He'll walk you through the exact gaps. Does tomorrow at 11 AM or Wednesday at 3 PM work better for you?",

        "acknowledge": "I completely understand budgeting is a real concern.",
        "reframe": "That's actually why I'm calling. This isn't an added cost; it's about recapturing revenue that's already leaving. The audit will show you the exact size of the opportunity before any commitment.",
